# BCS_A1_Semantics
This is the first assignment for BCS Full Stack Bootcamp, in which an existing website is to be modified to comply with semantic HTML naming conventions for accessibility purposes without modifying the outcome of the original code.

First I changed the generic div elements to semantic elements such as header, article and footer. I then edited the css page to relink the elements to the css(in some cases removing classes named after semanti elements altogether in favor of the actual elements,)

Finally I reorganized the style.css page and commented it to allow for more ease of reading.
